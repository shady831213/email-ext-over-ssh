    An email will be sent any time the build is unstable. A build is unstable if there
    are test failures, but all the build steps completed successfully.
    If the "Unstable - Still" trigger is configured, and the previous build status was "Unstable",
    then the "Unstable - Still" trigger will send an email instead.
